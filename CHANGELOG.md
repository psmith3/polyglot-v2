# __Changelog for Polyglot v2 on Synology Docker__

12/13/2019 - Created repository, forked from UDI Polyglot-v2
12/16/2019 - Changed the build soruce to use python:3.7-slim-buster to reduce the image size from debian:stretch with additional python, node and npm packages installed. Current image size is 678 MB. My goal is to ultimately use node:10-alpine but have not been sucessful getting the extraxted binary file to run in alpine due to the missing and unidenitifed dependencoes. In the current release by UDI for Polyglot-v2, the docker file references node:10-alpine and it does not recognoze the customparamsdoc. In the Tesla nodeserver for example, the customer parameters that show the key fields for username and password never appear. This dockerfile that references python:3.7-slim-buster and installs the binary does not have this issue. I would like to use the node:alpine-10 version due to the smaller size of the package. The problem seems to be something in the git repository. Currently waiting to see if someone from UDI or elsewhere will answer the open issue at https://github.com/UniversalDevicesInc/polyglot-v2/issues/82.
